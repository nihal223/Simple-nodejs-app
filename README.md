# nodejs-app
# This simple nodejs app contains three form fields and when submitted , they are stored in mongodb. Used monk to connect to the db
# the errors are andled in the middleware(using express-validator)
# A favicon is set which is present in the style folder
# Used jade for the views instead of a swig template engine
# hanvent used any promises for error propogation as there isnt much validation
# used GULP build system to show lint errors using JSHint 
# gulp-nodemon starts looks for any changes in the js files and watches them.

# P.S did this in one day.
