# nodejs-app
 + This simple nodejs app contains three form fields and when submitted , they are stored in mongodb. 
 + Used monk to connect to the db.
 + The errors are handled in the middleware(using express-validator).
 + A favicon is set which is present in the style folder.
 + Used jade for the views instead of a swig template engine.
 + Havent used any promises for error propogation as there isnt much validation.
 + Used GULP build system to show lint errors using JSHint.
 + gulp-nodemon starts looks for any changes in the js files and watches them.

 P.S did this in one day.
